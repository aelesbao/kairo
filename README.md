# Kiro: smart URL routing

Kiro is a tool that helps you open links in your preferred app in a smart and flexible way. It's built for people who use different browsers or browser profiles to separate work, personal, and development tasks, giving you full control over where each link goes.

When you open a link, Kiro shows a small window listing all the apps on your system that can handle it. You can see their names and icons, pick one instantly, or set Kiro to remember your choice for next time. It can also act as your system's default link handler, ensuring every link you click goes through Kiro first.

For power users, Kiro includes a CLI that provides the same features without leaving the terminal.

Kiro aims to be platform-independent, working across different desktop environments such as GNOME, KDE, Hyprland, and more. It currently supports Linux, with macOS support planned for upcoming releases.

This project was inspired by [Junction](https://junction.sonny.re/). I tried it for a while on GNOME and liked the way it worked. However, I couldn’t find a similar tool that worked across other environments, so I decided to build one that would be portable, modern, and accessible to Linux and macOS users. Kiro is still a work in progress, but is growing toward that goal.
